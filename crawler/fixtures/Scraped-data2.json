    "title": "4GB RAM NOT 8GB RAM!",
    "content": "This is NOT an 8GB RAM! It is only 4GB RAM! With that being said, it is advertised as an 8GB RAM, packaging was basically triple boxes, packaged very well! Came with backpack and mouse pad as described. Initial start up was slow, but moving fast now that it\u2019s set up. Only gave 3 stars because the RAM is a significant part in purchasing the right laptop!",

    "title": "Great Laptop, Good Value, well worth it",
    "content": "Amazon delivered my order promptly. This laptop bundle came in a solid double packaging, and it comes with a backpack and a mouse pad. I am so amazed by the backpack & mouse pad quality, and I don\u2019t mind the little legendary logo both accessories. I had HP laptops previously and had been pleased with their performance. This one is exceptional for someone who isn't into a lot of gaming and such. I am self employed and I bought this laptop for my work, I only need basic internet browsing and need to do some basic excel reporting, so this computer is perfect for me and at an amazing price, especially it came with bonus accessories.",

    "content": "I got a faulty laptop from day 1! Before I ordered I made sure to ask the seller if it\u2019s NEW.  Well, I got it and it shuts down every 2 minutes. They offered refund, but I live outside the US and returning this mess will cost me a lot. I thought it was tested/upgraded as stated. How can they missed mines when it shuts off right after start up?  Now I\u2019ve trust issues with purchasing electronics online now.",

    "title": "Pretty much everything that i was looking for in a large laptop",
    "content": "the box delivered on time and safe.  it was double boxed and packed well. the included laptop bag is good quality and will work well when i need to use it.  i would not buy this laptop for the bag but it is a nice value add. speed and response on this laptop is everything that i was looking for.  set up was easy and came 1/2 charged so i didn't have to immediately plug in. My only concern is battery life.  this is the largest laptop that i have ever had.  i use mainly for school and work.  i don't game or stream a lot of video.  but in the 4 hours that i have had the laptop open today, the battery has already dropped to 25%.  i don't know if that is to be expected with the multiple windows open and the large screen but i don't expect to get 8 hours out of the charge if i am on it.  I will keep the power cable near by.  if you are using less, you might make a full day on a charge.",

Since, the price is so good, I decided to re buy it.",

Reviews of Amazon electronic products found similar experiences of other buyers.  Makes me less likely to buy something computerized from Amazon--concerned they store stuff and handle electronics without proper care causing some of these issues.  This computer had a defective battery.  Is Amazon getting lower prices at the expense of quality?",

Between the excellent tutorials, \"Cortana,\" various upgrades, and a machine that seems almost intuitive when it comes to offering just what you need-for free-right when you needed it, I was almost overwhelmed with the creative possibilities so much so that I still can't get this grin off of my face! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",

Some days, the laptop would just shut off on its own, other days it would take an update and never start up and then there were days it would give me the blue screen of death. This laptop is cheaply made with buggy software and a strange temperament.  To make matters worse, the WIFI card died in just 11 months so I could no longer access the internet without an ethernet cable. I bought an Acer to replace it. I am hoping for better luck.",
